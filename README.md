# GIFtastic
A simple web application to demonstrate giphy api calls.

## Features
Jquery is the primary feature of this assignment, using AJAX to make API calls to retrieve lists of gifs based on dynamically generated topic buttons.  Users may add their own topics if they choose.

## Challenges
Formatting continues to be diffult.  I am having struggling to use Bootstrap's grid system in a way that functions as I want it to.
